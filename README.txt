Project: Search Implementation
by Tyler Edwards 
Added February 2023

Description: Implement Uniform Cost Search then upgrade it into the A* Search, given a set or graph of data.

Language: Python

Reason: For CPSC 390 (Artificial Intelligence)

Successes: After the Uniform Cost Serach was established, going to A* was not too difficult.

Setbacks: Code would complile but the logic of the Uniform Cost Search was slightly off, forcing me to go back through the lgogic of my solution. Also, for the A* Search there was some complications with getting the heuristic values to print and be implemented properly.

Learned: good implementation of overriding functions, implementation of serach algorithms given a set of data
